        <h2 class="white_text centered">Biography</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="white_text centered">Dir En Grey (stylized as DIR EN GREY and previously as Dir en grey) is a Japanese heavy metal band formed in February
        1997 and currently signed to Firewall Div., a sub-division of Free-Will. With a consistent lineup of guitarists Kaoru
        and Die, vocalist Kyo, drummer Shinya and bassist Toshiya, they have released eleven full-length records. Numerous
        stylistic changes have made the genre of their music difficult to determine, though it is generally considered to be a
        form of metal. Originally a visual kei band, the members later opted for more subtle attire, but have continued to
        maintain a dramatic image on stage.<br><br><br><br>
          </p>

        <h2 class="white_text centered">Career</h2>
        <br><br>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="white_text centered">1997-1999: Early career:<br><br>

        Dir En Grey was preceded by the independent rock band La:Sadie's, which included four of Dir En Grey's members before
        disbanding. They disbanded due to leader and bassist Kisaki not wanting to debut as he felt that it was too
        soon, but guitarist Kaoru believed that they were ready for it. After parting ways with Kisaki, members Kaoru, Kyo, Die
        and Shinya recruited bassist Toshiya and regrouped as a new band. After playing one show as a Kuroyume cover-band called
        DEATHMASK at the live house Nagano J on January 24, they officially formed "Dir en grey" on February 2, 1997.<br><br>

        The band name is a combination of German "dir", French "en" and English "grey" and was thought to mean "Grey Silver
        Coin" (灰色の銀貨, Haiiro no Ginka); the Japanese translation was used as the name of their fanclub's magazine. They
        wanted to convey a musical image that was neither black nor white, so they picked grey. In an early interview,
        vocalist Kyo explained that he knew the name before the band was formed. During the WOWOW Special in 2020, Kaoru
        elaborates that they took the name from another band that was famous around that time. This band was Lareine, who had
        released a song called "Dir en gray" in 1995. The song starts with the line 灰色のあなたに dir en gray, with the Latin part
        being a correct translation of the Japanese part. Both mean "to you in grey". In a later interview, Kaoru explained that
        "at the time we chose the band name, it had some meaning but right now it doesn't express the band anymore, so it has
        come to not mean anything specific. We chose the band name because it sounded right, and it also reflects an image that
        probably doesn't exist elsewhere."<br><br>

        They released their first EP, Missa, a few months later and attracted mainstream attention in 1998, by entering the top
        ten on the Oricon music charts with the still independently produced songs "Jealous" and "-I'll-". Five
        subsequent singles, arranged and produced by X Japan co-founder Yoshiki Hayashi, were published during the first half of
        1999. The band's first full-length record, Gauze, followed. One of the shows in support for the album (filmed at the
        Osaka-jo Hall) would later become the first of several live concerts to be released on VHS and DVD.
        2000-2004: From Macabre to Vulgar<br><br>

        In 2000, vocalist Kyo was hospitalized with hearing trouble and several dates of the tour in support of Dir En Grey's
        then-upcoming album, Macabre, had to be postponed. Tour 00 >> 01 Macabre eventually took off later the same year and was
        concluded at Nippon Budokan shortly after the release of the single "Ain't Afraid to Die" in April 2001.<br><br>

        In the following year, along with the release of a third full-length album, Kisou, Dir En Grey gave their first
        performances abroad, touring China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Back in Japan, the last dates of the lengthy Rettou
        Gekishin Angya tour were already in support for the band's second EP, Six Ugly. In the same year, they released the
        single "Child Prey", which was featured as the second opening theme of the Baki the Grappler anime series, and also the
        beginning of their fourth album called Vulgar. In summer 2003, Dir En Grey performed at Akasaka Blitz for five evenings
        in a single week, with each show (except the first) themed after a certain album, the last featuring songs from the then
        yet to be released Vulgar. A DVD set, titled Blitz 5 Days, was later released exclusively for members of the band's
        official fan club, titled "A Knot". Vulgar was released in September 2003 and tours in support for the record would last
        well into 2004.<br><br>
        2005-2006: Early non-Asian touring:<br><br>

        In 2005, Dir En Grey performed in Europe for the first time. Their concerts in Berlin and Paris (as part of the It
        Withers and Withers tour) sold out without promotion save for newsletters by import record stores and internet-based
        word of mouth.<br><br>

        The band also performed at two major festivals, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park. Becoming more involved with the
        international music scene, French band Eths opened for them at the Paris concert and Dir en Grey invited American
        musician Wednesday 13 and his band to play at a show in Japan. Dir En Grey also appeared at the Japanese leg of that
        year's Taste of Chaos tour.<br><br>

        2005 saw the group's first official European releases as well, beginning with Withering to Death. The band's music had
        previously been available through means of import and Internet file-sharing only for European fans. The album achieved
        Dir En Grey's first non-Asian chart position, reaching No. 31 in the Finnish album charts. The subsequent single,
        "Clever Sleazoid", later climbed to No. 15 on the singles charts in the same country. Several Dir En Grey songs were
        also featured in the soundtrack of the 2005 film Death Trance.<br><br>

        In early 2006 touring expanded to the United States. The band performed in Austin, Texas at the South by Southwest
        festival, New York City at the Avalon Club and Los Angeles, California at the Wiltern Theatre, followed by the North
        American release of Withering to Death. Again, all shows sold out within days. After more concerts and festival
        appearances in Germany during the summer, singer Kyo was again hospitalized due to inflamed vocal cords. While two
        concert dates in Japan had to be postponed, Dir En Grey was still able to join Korn's Family Values Tour 2006. In
        October, the band was back in Japan to perform at the Loudpark Festival, along with bands such as Megadeth, Slayer and
        Children of Bodom. Their 22nd single "Agitated Screams of Maggots" was released on 15 November during the Japanese
        leg of the Inward Scream tour. On 30 December, the music video for -Saku- was voted the No. 1 video of the year on the
        MTV2 show Headbangers Ball.<br><br>
        2007-2009: The Marrow of a Bone and Uroboros:<br><br>

        In February, Dir En Grey went on its first North American headlining tour, visiting sixteen cities as its sixth
        full-length album The Marrow of a Bone was released on February 7 in Japan and in the United States and Europe in the
        following months. From May to July, the group opened for the Deftones on their United States tour and afterwards did
        another European tour, which included their debut shows in Denmark, Finland, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, as
        well as several festival performances across the continent, including Ankkarock, M'era Luna Festival and Wacken Open
        Air.<br><br>

        The group went on another international tour in September named after their most recent single "Dozing Green", beginning
        in Japan and continuing in Europe, including their first performance in the Netherlands and Switzerland. In late
        November, Dir En Grey opened two shows for Linkin Park at Saitama Super Arena and in December performed another Japan
        tour with 10 Years as a supporting act. Commemorating Dir En Grey's tenth anniversary as a band, two greatest hits
        compilations, titled Decade 1998-2002 and Decade 2003-2007 respectively, were released on December 19.<br><br>

        At the beginning of 2008, Dir En Grey announced plans to begin recording a new studio album. Their first touring of
        the year in May was another Japan tour with a conclusion of three shows at Shinkiba Studio Coast, titled Death over
        Blindness. Between touring, Dir En Grey performed at one night of the two-night hide memorial summit on May 4, alongside
        X Japan, Luna Sea, and others. A second Japanese tour, titled Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again began on September 10,
        the same day as the release of their single "Glass Skin".<br><br>

        On August 1, Dir En Grey announced the release of their seventh studio album, Uroboros, which was released on November
        11, 2008, in the United States. The band also toured the United States and Canada in support of the album, with
        dates scheduled for November and December (overlapping the release of Uroboros) with opening act The Human Abstract.
        Touring that fall included a series of four shows titled Bajra, two being fan-club exclusive, and a single show on
        December 29 under the moniker Uroboros -Breathing- at the famous Osaka-jo Hall where Dir En Grey had not performed since
        December 18, 1999 (as seen on 1999.12.18 Osakajo Hall).<br><Br>

        Beginning in 2009, Dir En Grey made their first thorough tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland with Kerrang!'s
        "Relentless Tour '09" alongside Mindless Self Indulgence, Bring Me the Horizon, Black Tide and In Case of Fire. In
        February, the band announced the public release of the live DVD, Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again, as well as switching
        European record labels to the newly founded Okami Records, a sister label of their former European representation,
        Gan-Shin.<br><br>

        During spring of 2009, the band began to fully promote Uroboros with a series of nationwide tours under the title Tour
        09 Feast of V Senses. The tour was interrupted briefly while in Sapporo and Sendai, with an announcement on the band's
        official website, explaining that Kyo had been diagnosed with edema of the larynx, and would require the postponement of
        three shows, which were rescheduled for early May.<br>
        Dir En Grey in Saarbrücken, Germany, in 2009<br><br>

        Dir En Grey continued their Feast of V Senses tour in Europe, with a mixture of festival performances, headlining shows,
        and one co-headlining show with Killswitch Engage. The festival performances included their third appearances at Rock am
        Ring and Rock im Park, as well as their initial concerts at Download Festival, Nova Rock, and Metaltown. Among the
        headlining shows, Dir En Grey were also making debut concerts in Italy and the Czech Republic.

        After several shows of their late-summer tour, All Visible Things, Dir En Grey announced their next single for December,
        "Hageshisa to, Kono Mune no Naka de Karamitsuita Shakunetsu no Yami", as well as a North American and South American
        tour also under the title All Visible Things. Their new single was released on December 2, 2009, and reached number 2 on
        the Oricon Weekly Chart: the highest position to date for the band. Their 2009 tour season ended with a three-live tour
        titled Dorje. They finally ended their long Uroboros centered tour by doing two back to back performances at the Nippon
        Budokan, titled Uroboros: with the proof in the name of living..., where tickets sold out in 15 minutes.<br><br>
        2010-2013: Dum Spiro Spero and The Unraveling:<br><br>

        It was announced on April 7, 2010, that the band would be returning to the United Kingdom in August on the lineup for
        the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, playing on a bill headlined by Iron Maiden and Rammstein. According to the
        festival website, this was to be their only UK festival performance during the year. Regarding the announcement, Kaoru
        (on the Sonisphere UK website) is quoted as saying: "I'd never have thought that we would play a festival of this
        caliber! It is like a dream come true to be playing with such great bands at Sonisphere. Although we're not back in the
        UK for a tour, we wanted to play this festival to give something back to the fans who were disappointed last year from
        our cancelled finale in London."<br><br>

        It was announced on April 28, 2010, that Dir En Grey would be playing an exclusive club date at London's Koko venue on
        August 3 as part of The Unwavering Fact of Tomorrow Tour 2010. Dir En Grey announced later on that they also would
        do their debut performances in Russia by adding one show in Moscow at Tochka Club on August 5 and one show in St
        Petersburg at Glav Club on August 6. Dir En Grey also toured North America on a co-headlining tour with the Finnish
        band Apocalyptica with a special guest of Kyo interpreting the song "Bring Them to Light", one of the tracks of the
        cello-metalers latest record.<br><br>

        In September 2010 the band confirmed in an interview with Kerrang! magazine that they were in the process of writing new
        material for the follow-up to Uroboros. In addition to "Hageshisa to, Kono Mune no Naka de Karamitsuita Shakunetsu
        no Yami" appearing on the soundtrack of the American movie Saw 3D, they also participated on December 1, 2010's
        Romantist - The Stalin, Michiro Endo Tribute Album by covering "Warushawa no Gensō" in celebration of the 60th birthday
        of The Stalin's frontman Michiro Endo. The album also featured bands such as Buck-Tick, Group Tamashii, Merry, Jun
        Togawa, and Wagdug Futuristic Unity.<br><br>

        The single "Lotus" was released on January 26, 2011, along with a new fan-club only tour named The Decomposition of the
        Moon, scheduled to run from May 14 to 26. The band released "Different Sense" on June 22. On August 1, 2011, Dir
        en Grey released an open letter on their official Facebook that accused the Japanese government of lying to its people
        and hiding the true danger of the radiation levels after the nuclear accidents caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and
        tsunami. In October, the band launched a campaign called Scream for the Truth, complete with a website and a billboard
        hanging in Times Square in New York City, in hopes of stopping the alleged misinformation and getting correct
        numbers. Their eighth studio album, Dum Spiro Spero, was released on August 3. Material from this album was
        showcased on the band's South and North American tour Age Quod Agis in November and December 2011.<br><br>

        In February 2012, following a doctor's visit, vocalist Kyo was diagnosed with vocal nodule dysphonia, leading to Dir
        En Grey pulling out of the North American The Still Reckless Tour consisting of Asking Alexandria, Trivium, Motionless
        in White, and I See Stars. Although Kyo had been hospitalized before in 2006 and 2009 for vocal inflammation, he had not
        required surgery until this time. Kyo later stated that his condition was treated with medication.<br><br>

        On August 11, 2012, Dir En Grey won the Extreme Metal Olympics organized by Loudwire.com, beating Death in the
        final. The band released the single "Rinkaku" on December 19 after their one-year and a half hiatus since their
        previous single release. Also, a tour titled In Situ began on December 25 in Tokyo.<br><br>

        On April 3, 2013, they released their third EP, titled The Unraveling, with one new song and six re-recordings. Just

        <h2 class="white_text centered">Musical Style and Influences</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="white_text centered">Since the release of their album Uroboros in 2008, Dir En Grey have been repeatedly described as progressive metal.
        Uroboros and their 2011 album Dum Spiro Spero represent a particular musical departure from previous albums, with
        critics noting that their sound on these albums bears almost nothing in common to their earliest work. With
        Uroboros, and particularly on Dum Spiro Spero, the band have moved away from their alternative rock roots towards a
        heavier metal sound. These albums feature complex song structures and guitarwork, longer track lengths, and a
        broader variety of particularly western influences, such as death metal, deathcore and groove metal.<br><br>Kyo's singing is considered a pivotal aspect of the band, and he has gained recognition for his distinctive vocal work
        and for his large range and versatility, being able to "howl, croon, emote cleanly, scream, shriek, growl, bellow, and
        make nearly inhuman sounds." Jurek has compared him favorably to experimental and avant-garde vocalists Mike Patton
        and Diamanda Galas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
